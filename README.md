# 1BRC: One Billion Row Challenge in Python

Python implementation of Gunnar's 1 billion row challenge:
- https://www.morling.dev/blog/one-billion-row-challenge
- https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc

## Creating the measurements file with 1B rows

First install the Python requirements:
```shell
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The script `createMeasurements.py` will create the measurement file:
```
usage: createMeasurements.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-r RECORDS]

Create measurement file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Measurement file name (default is "measurements.txt")
  -r RECORDS, --records RECORDS
                        Number of records to create (default is 1_000_000_000)
```

Example:
```
% python3 createMeasurements.py
Creating measurement file 'measurements.txt' with 1,000,000,000 measurements...
100%|█████████████████████████████████████████| 100/100 [01:15<00:00,  1.32it/s]
Created file 'measurements.txt' with 1,000,000,000 measurements in 75.86 seconds
```

Be patient as it can take more than a minute to have the file generated.

Maybe as another challenge is to speed up the generation of the measurements file :slightly_smiling_face:
